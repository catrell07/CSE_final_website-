      <h1>Insight on Younger Drivers</h1>
      <p>The feeling of obtaining your license is a feeling like no other. To youngster, a license means freedom and fast moving object. Two things young people aren't used to. The following visualizations display information about drivers under 16 to 29.</p>
      <iframe src="./fig5.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
      <p>The bar graph shows fascinating information on drivers under 16. South Carolina has the highest amount of drivers under the age of 16. Although California usually has the highest amount of drivers for every other age group, California has no drivers under 16. Many states have no drivers under 16 which may be due to the minimum driving age being 16+.This visualization can be used to determine which states have a younger minimum driving age and which states have an older minimum driving age. It could also be compared to car crash data to determine if states with a higher number of drivers under 16 have a correlation with a higher number of car crashes.</p>
      <iframe src="./young_fig3.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
      <p>The bar graph displayes the state against the cumulative amount of 18 year old drivers of both male and female, from 1994-2023. There are more cumulative male drivers than female drivers that are 18 years old over the last 30 years. The states with the highest populations, such as California and Texas, have the highest amount of 18 year old drivers. This information could be used to determine which states have the lowest and highest amount of 18 year old drivers from 1994-2023. </p>
      <iframe src="./young_fig6.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
      <p>The scatter plots display each state compared to the amount of 21 year old drivers, split up by male and female. The color demonstrates the year. The warmer the color, the higher the year. The cooler the color, the lower the year. Texas and California are outliers with the highest population of 21 year old drivers. The plot also shows that there are more male 21 year old drivers than femal 21 year old drivers. It is also seen that the higher the year, the more drivers there are due to the warm colors indication higher years appearing at the top of each line. These graphs can be used to compare the amounts of 21 year old male and female drivers per state. </p>
      <iframe src="./young_fig9.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
      <p>The pie graph displays the distributrion of the cumulative amount of drivers aged 25-29 in each state. States with a smaller population contain a smaller portion of the pie chart, while states with a larger population contain a higher portion of the pie chart.  This chart can be used to assess which state has the most or least amount of drivers aged 25-29 in the last 30 years. The trend of California having the highest amount of drivers continues. </p>
