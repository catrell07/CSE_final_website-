      <h1>Insight on Older Drivers </h1>
      <p>Granny got run over by a reindeer!... or did she run the reindeer over?... Whether she got run over or she did the running over, it's important to know about our older folks on the road with us. The following visualizations display information about those 30 and older.</p>
      <iframe src="./old_fig8.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
        <p>This bar graph displays the amount of 30-34 year olds from each state form 1994-2023. California has the highest population of 30-34 year old drivers. Smaller states such as Delaware and Vermont have a much lower number of 30-34 year old drivers. The years progress from cool to warm colors. States with a lower population have a lower amount of drivers within this range. This can be used to determine the which states have the highest and lowest population of drivers between age 30-34 for certain years. This graph also supports the trend of higher populations of drivers as years increase.</p>
        <iframe src="./old_fig7.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
        <p>The bubble graph displays the cumulative amount of 45-49 year old drivers per state from 1994-2023. The red bubbles indicate females and the blue bubbles indicates males. The graph displays more female of drivers aged 45-49 than male drivers. California and Texas are the only states to have over 1 million drivers aged 45-49. This visualization can be used to determine what gender and state have the most 45-49 year old drivers from 1994-2023. </p>
        <iframe src="./old_fig11.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
        <p>This bar graph shows the count of male and female inputs for indviduals aged 50-54. This graph displays that there are one female and one male section for each year of drivers their early 50s. From 1994-2023 is 30 years, so there are 30 inputs for males and 30 inputs for females. This graph may be used more for infering how the data set has a 1 to 1 ratio of female and male inputs. </p>
        <iframe src="./old_fig10.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
        <p>The heat map displays the density of 65-69 year old drivers for in each state from 1994-2023 for both male and female drivers. The warmer colors are higher concentrations and the cooler colors are lower concentration. This graph can be used to identity which states have a higher density of 65-69 year old drivers over the 30 years. Smaller states have higher concentration with a smaller amount of drivers. Larger states have a more spread out concentration of drivers. This graph can also be used to determine which states are most popular amongst 65-69 year old drivers. </p>
        <iframe src="./old_fig2.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
        <p> The scatter plot displays the amount of female and male drivers over 85 in California from 1994-2023. As the years increase, the amount of drivers over 85 increase. There are also generally more male than female drivers over the age of 85 for each year. This graph can be used to mitigate the risk of fatal elderly accidents in each state of elderly drivers on the road. This visualization could also be compared to car crash data to see if there is a correlation between elderly drivers and car crashes in California. </p>
